				<!-- Introduction -->
				<h2>Short Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Hi my name is Muhammad Eezzuan Muhammad Akbar. I am an aspiring web developer and software engineer.
				</p>

				<p>
					On my free time, I like to solve puzzles, riddles and as well as playing chess. Generally I love activities that stimulates my mind because in my line of work, I need to be able to think ahead and outside of the box.

				<!-- Other Project-->
				<h2> Side Project </h2>
				<p>
					Currently I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVBAPGKILcCzaYMzvYnpGGg?view_as=subscriberYoutube"> Youtube Channel </a> which I used to do Let's Plays. In case you are wondering, Let's Plays or LP's for short is just a term used by youtubers or when they record their gameplay or walkthrough and upload them to youtube for people to watch and enjoy.
				</p>

				<p>
					That being said, one of the skills that I have gained from being a youtuber is <strong>video editing</strong>. Below you will find one of my playlist for LP's that I have completed and I hope that you will enjoy watching.

				<!-- Third Part: Location -->
				<h2> Where Am I Based? </h2>
				<p>
					Currently I am based in Malaysia but to be exact, in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. Nearby areas within the state of Kuala Lumpur are always doable for me. In fact I do not mind going the distance (anywhere in Malaysia) as long as it does not impose any constraint on my personal goals and achievements.
