		<h2> Brief Introduction </h2>
		<p> 
			My name is Muhammad Eezzuan and I am 26 years old. I am a practioner of various martial arts which includes <em>Wing Chun</em>, <em>Muay Thai</em> and <em>Brazillian Jiujitsu</em> just to name a few. However, over the years, I gave up the mantle of becoming a fighter, instead I became a lover.

		<p>  What kind of lover you may ask? The kind that loves a good sport and helping those that are in need. I firmly believe that in order to change the world, we must first change ourselves. In other words, be the change that you want the world to be.

		<p> On a lighter note, here is a video from my youtube channel. Note that I have not been updating for quite awhile <strong>but that does not mean that I'm quitting!</strong>
